                In India, there are more than 13 million working employees and every person earns a different salary according to their location, age, experience, and skill set. In this fast-moving world, they hardly get time to sit and analyse their expenditure in a detailed manner which often leads to negligence on certain aspects because they do not seem to be important at that time but may be problematic later. These may include saving money for health care, sudden expenditures and expenses due to family emergencies, sudden requirement of an item that breaks down unexpectedly, and other financial losses that occur. Saving as a concept is closely connected to the way we manage our expenses and hence the right budget can help us save more and save right. When we lay down our savings we need to make sure that it's neither too much that it leads to unnecessary personal lifestyle sacrifices nor too little that it can't help us in our financial emergencies.Apart from savings they need to focus on their daily and monthly monetary requirements according to their lifestyle and set the proper amounts required for that expense in such a way that it exactly suits the purpose. Hence budgeting requires a much deeper analysis rather than a pen-and-paper model where monthly expenses are stated according to the expenditures that are coming forward.An automated system that can guide us as to what our budget could be like can help us to better estimate our budgets and can give us key insights into our spending nature.
